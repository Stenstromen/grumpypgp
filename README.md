# GrumpyPGP

React Native app for sending encrypted messages using PGP.

The lack of a good PGP app for iOS makes the cat grumpy.

*PGP is a standard for encrypting messages using public key cryptography. It's a great way to send secure messages to people without having to worry about the security of the channel you're using to send the message. It's also a great way to store encrypted messages in a database, since the messages can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.*
